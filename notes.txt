[expression/transformation     iteration     condition]

do not have to have expression or condition
iteration is required

Example without list comprehension:

list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]
list2 = []

for x in list1:
    if x > 20:
        x *= x
        list2.append(x)

Example with list comprehension:

list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]
list2 = []

list2 = [x*x for x in list1 if x>20]

List comprehension will always produce a list
